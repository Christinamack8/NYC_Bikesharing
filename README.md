## Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.
