# NYC_Bikesharing


## Using Tableau, create visualizations that show:

* How long bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
* How many trips are taken by the hour for each day of the week, for all riders and genders.
* A breakdown of what days of the week a user might be more likely to check out a bike, by type of user and gender.

## Summary

The results showed that male users used bike share the most in warmer weather during rush hour.
This implies that Citi Bike services are used as an alternative to public transportation by commuting workers.


Additional analysis:

Finding out how far users had to walk to a bike share and if that determined their usage.
If there is a correlation between at what temperature a user would not use bike share.
